# Project Summary:

This project aims to build an intelligent **Chat Search AI system** that helps users find real
estate projects through natural language queries like “3BHK flat in Pune under ₹1.2 Cr.”


Instead of using filters, users can chat with the interface—built using React + Tailwind CSS
—to get instant, data-driven property recommendations. The backend (powered by Java
Spring Boot ) processes user messages, extracts key filters such as city, BHK type, budget,
and locality, and searches through the provided CSV datasets containing project, address,
and configuration details.


It then generates a short, meaningful summary based solely on CSV data and displays a
list of matching project cards with details like price, location, status, and BHK. This system
combines natural language understanding, structured data retrieval, and a user-friendly
interface to make property discovery faster, smarter, and more interactive.

# Setup Guide

# Frontend Setup Guide

**1. Clone the Repo
Open a terminal in VS Code or WebStorm and run:**
`git clone https://github.com/VivekGits7/NoBroDirectAI-FrontEnd.git`


**Then go inside the project folder:`cd NoBroDirectAI-FrontEnd`

**2. Install Dependencies
Since node_modules is not in your repo, install them fresh using npm:**
`npm install`
**This reads the package.json file and downloads all required libraries (React, Vite,
Tailwind, Framer Motion, etc.) into a new node_modules folder.**

**3. Run the Development Server
Start the app with: `npm run dev`

**After a few seconds, you’ll see an output like:**
_VITE v5.0.0 ready in 400ms_

 ➜ Local: http://localhost:5173/

**Open that URL in your browser.**

# Backend Setup Guide

**1. Clone the Repo**
Open a terminal in **IntelliJ IDEA** or **Eclipse IDE** and run:
In the **IntelliJ IDEA** Project Section, click the Clone Repository button and give the
**Backend code repo URL: `https://github.com/VivekGits7/NoBroDirectAI-BackEnd`
Then go inside the project folder: `cd NoBroDirectAI-BackEnd`

**2. Check Maven Dependencies**
If not automatically downloaded, you can manually install them:
`mvn clean install`
This will:

- Download all dependencies from pom.xml
- Compile the source
- Create the target folder with the .jar file

**3. Run the Spring Boot Application**
Run this command inside the project root:
`mvn spring-boot: run`

**Backend is running on:**
`http://localhost:8083/api/search`
**Or Run the JAR File
Run your Spring Boot backend:**
`java -jar NoBroDirectAI-BackEnd.jar`


**4. Verify API Endpoint**
Test your main API using Postman or Curl:

POST _[http://localhost:8083/api/search](http://localhost:8083/api/search)_
Content-Type: application/json
```{
"query": "1BHK residential apartment located at Prataprao Gujar Rd, Neelam Nagar, Mulund East, Mumbai,
Maharashtra 400081, near JBCN International School Mulund.
It is unfurnished and currently under construction, featuring 1 bathroom and 1 balcony, priced at around ₹1.
crore.

"
}
```

```
**6. Change Port or Config (Optional)**
If port 8083 is busy, change it in:
src/main/resources/application.properties
server.port=

**7. Connect Frontend + Backend**
Once the backend is running:
    - Make sure your frontend’s .env file has:
    - VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:
    - Then start your frontend:
    - `npm run dev`
    - The React chat UI will call your backend endpoint at
       [http://localhost:8083/api/search](http://localhost:8083/api/search)

# API Endpoints Overview


**1. Search Projects**

```
URL: POST localhost:8083/api/search
```
Description: Accepts a search query and returns matching property/project listings
from the CSV data store.
```
Notes: The summary is derived only from the CSV datasets (no external data). The project's array lists matched items with key details. If no matches are found, it returns a message summarising the absence and may propose broader filters.
```
**2. (Potential) Other Endpoints**
Based on the project’s architecture (controller/service layers) you may have or add these
endpoints in the future:

```
Endpoint Method Purpose
GET /api/allProperties GET Retrieve all properties detailed from the CSV file
POST /api/filter POST Takes natural language text and extracts filters
GET /api/health GET Health-check endpoint (status of service/data)
```
**Note:** These are suggested/typical endpoints; verify their presence in your code.
If any exist in your controller package, document them similarly.

**Frontend UI Overview**
The app has 4 main sections:

```
Section Description
Header Shows project title and links to your profiles
Notes Section Detailed guide on how to format queries for best results
Chat Window Shows a conversation between the user and the AI (bot)

# Notes — How to Use This Property Chat AI

# Purpose:
This AI helps you search properties and projects using simple **natural language** — but it’s not a full
GPT model. It’s a **lightweight AI** trained only on **83 property entries** from a local dataset.
So, to get the best results, your query must be **specific** , **well-structured** , and **spelled correctly**.

# How to Search Correctly

**Follow this format for best results:**

BHK PROPERTY_TYPE apartment located in FULLADDRESS, near LANDMARK.
It is FURNISHED_TYPE and currently STATUS, featuring NU BATHROOMS and NU BALCONIES,
priced at around **₹** NU Crore/Lakh/K etc.

Field Details

BHK → 1, 2, 3, 4
PROPERTY_TYPE → Residential, Commercial, Any
FULLADDRESS → Example: Sindhi Society, Near Swami Vivekanand Jr College, Chembur, Mumbai
Harbour, Mumbai
LANDMARK → Example: JBCN International School Mulund
FURNISHED_TYPE → Unfurnished, Furnished, Semi-Furnished, None
STATUS → Ready to Move, Under Construction
BATHROOMS → 1, 2, 3, 4
BALCONIES → 1, 2, 3, 4
PRICE → ₹NU Crore / Lakh / K

Tip:
Use clear and complete details for address, landmark, and price.
Avoid vague terms like cheap flat or low price apartment.

**Example of a perfect search:**

1BHK residential apartment located in Mumbai Chembur, near Babys School. It is unfurnished and
currently under construction, featuring 1 bathroom and 1 balcony, priced at around ₹1.1 Crore.

# Important Guidelines

- Always **mention BHK** at the start.
- Add **city** and **locality name** (e.g., Mumbai Chembur).
- Include **bathroom** and **balcony** count.
- Write the **price at the end** in clear format (₹1.1 Crore / ₹85 Lakh / ₹90L).


- Use full sentences and correct spelling — the AI is **regex-based** , not semantic like
    ChatGPT.
- Avoid shorthand, typos, or vague inputs (e.g., “cheap flat Mumbai”).
- Don’t skip important words like “ready to move”, “under construction”, or “unfurnished”.

# Why Precision Matters

This AI runs on a **custom model** with **limited parameters** , not billions like normal GPTs.
It only matches patterns from a **small dataset (83 property entries)** — so every keyword you type
helps it understand:

- The **location**
- The **price range**
- The **BHK type**
- The **furnishing and readiness status**

Being precise ensures the AI can **filter and summarize** your query accurately.
